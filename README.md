# Data-Preprocessing
IML lab for data preprocessing
A csv file has been provided to you. The given dataset contains 12 columns and
description for each column is available here. In the given dataset, “salary_in_usd” is the target
variable. Answer the following based on this.

Q1) Assign a type to each of the following features manually as well as using a code if possible:
(a) Job Title, (b) salary, (c ) company size

Q2) Write a function to handle missing values in the dataset (e.g., any NA, NaN values), and
demonstrate/discuss its functioning in the report. 

Q3) Write a function to reduce noise (any error) in individual attributes and demonstrate/discuss
its functioning in the report. 

Q4) Write a function to encode all the categorical features in the dataset according to the type of
variable jointly, and demonstrate/discuss its functioning in the report.

Q5) Write a function to normalize / scale the features either individually or jointly, and
demonstrate/discuss its functioning in the report.

Q6) Write a function to create a random split of the data into three subsets (train, validation and
test sets) in the ratio of 70:20:10 respectively.
(a) Using numpy operation
(b) Using library function
